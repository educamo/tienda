and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate commercial use of the Program, the Contributor which includes
the Program in a commercial product offering must do so in a way that does not create a potential liability for others
Collaborators. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, said Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify the Author ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any loss, damage and cost arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
filed by a third party against the indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial partner in connection with your distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claim or loss related to any real or alleged intellectual
property infringement. To qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) immediately notify the Commercial
Written contributor of such claim, and b) allow Commercial Contributor to control and cooperate with him
Commercial collaborator in the defense and any related conciliation negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any claim at her own expense.

In this section, the Commercial Collaborator would have to defend the claims against the other Collaborators related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Taxpayer to pay damages as a result,
the Commercial Taxpayer must pay for those damages.
